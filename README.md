# PeachKit üçë
## A Swifty way of interacting with Peach.cool's undocumented API.

This is a total work in process. Currently, the following is mapped:

- Authentication
- "Connections"
- Creating text posts
- Reading streams

It requires Alamofire and SwiftyJSON as dependencies. There's currently no podspec as it's a submodule of a larger project.
